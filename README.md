The Bark of the Hound Language is a domain specific programming language 
capable of manipulating sets. This language is able to take finite sets as input 
and manipulate them to create new sets. The language also includes 
features found in general purpose programming languages such as printing, 
looping, conditionals, mathematical operators, and boolean operators that can 
be used to solve a wide variety of problems. All inputs are assumed to be a 
sequence of finite sets followed by a positive integer, which represents the 
maximum size of the output set.

The interpreter has been written using OCamllex and OCamlyacc.
